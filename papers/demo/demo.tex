\section{Demonstration}
In this section we describe our proposed demonstration setup to showcase \system's functionality.
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the demo 'story'. Start with the end-to-end (user does X in the interface, result appears as Y), then explain under the hood.
\item Describe the dataset
\item Describe the query workload
\item Story ideas: have a 'crowd mode' so attendees can clean data, do a drill-down EDA workflow that improves as more data is cleaned, show a real-time dashboard of aggregates that refreshes as the data gets cleaned, do data cleaning before featurizing/training ML models, have pipelines of multiple cleaning operations.
\end{itemize}
